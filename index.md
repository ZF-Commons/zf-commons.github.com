ZF-Commons
==========

ZF-Commons maintains a group of modules that we believe will be useful to many ZF2 developers. We hope that by providing best-of-breed solutions to common requirements, we will help developers concentrate on the interesting things that their applications do.


Rules
-----

 * We are a consensus based group.
 * New modules should be relevant for at least half of the existing members so that we can ensure long term maintenance
 * All members can edit all modules.
 * Please get a review from another member for any complicated work.
 * Like ZF2's development, we use feature branches for larger changes.
