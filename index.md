title: ZF-Commons
subtitle: Modules for Zend Framework 2
---

ZF-Commons maintains a group of modules that we believe will be useful to many [Zend Framework 2][zf2] developers. We hope that by providing best-of-breed solutions to common requirements, we will help developers concentrate on the interesting things that their applications do.

The code
--------
The code is on [github][github]! We recommend using git's [submodule][gitsubmodule] command to install into your `vendor` folder.


Contact
-------
You will find us on the [#zftalk.2][zft2] IRC channel on [freenode][freenode].


Rules
-----

 * We are a consensus based group.
 * New modules should be relevant for at least half of the existing members so that we can ensure long term maintenance
 * All members can edit all modules.
 * Please get a review from another member for any complicated work.
 * Like ZF2's development, we use feature branches for larger changes.
 

Thanks
------
Our thanks to the [FriendsOfSymfony][fos] for inspiration and the rules :)
